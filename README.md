`immediate` is an architecture and set of libraries for building rich, reactive
user interfaces, where the application and the rendering target can be separated
by an asynchronous communication medium (such as the web). This design allows
developers to build web applications entirely on the server, using familiar
languages and libraries.

library for your language of choice:
